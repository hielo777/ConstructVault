# Construct Projects Vault

This is a vault containing Construct 2 and Construct 3 sample projects.

***I do not claim authorship of these projects.*** I just want to have a centralized repo for  samples from the forums, blogs, and tutorials that I have collected over the years.

The entire purpose of this repo is educational. I have tinkered with some of these projects, and have learn countless lessons learning by example.

If you know the author of any of these projects, please let me know and I will set the right attributions.

A million thanks to the Construct community and to the kind people of Scirra.


### Roadmap

+ 1: Migrate the projects that I have collected to this repo
+ 2: Create folders that facilitate search and project attribution
+ 3: Add comments that could help learning from the projects
+ 4: Share projects I have created or modified using the base ones
+ 5: Create some educationa content, like videos, explaining different aspects of Construct 3, and game development in general.
