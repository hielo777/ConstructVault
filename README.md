# Construct Projects Vault

This is a vault containing Construct 2 and Construct 3 sample projects.

I do not claim authorship of these projects. I just want to have a centralized repo for  samples from the forums, blogs, and tutorials that I have collected over the years.

The entire purpose of this repo is educational. I have tinkered with some of these projects, and have learn countless lessons learning by example.

If you know the author of any of these projects, please let me know and I will set the right attributions.

A million thanks to the Construct community and to the kind people of Scirra.
